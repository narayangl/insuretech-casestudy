# Insurance (InsurTech) Case Study

## Overview and Origin
Insurance (InsurTech) domain deals with technology innovations in the Insurance sector. This is Intended to disrupt the traditional model of insurances. InsurTech Offers customized policies, social insurance, and using new streams of data from Internet-enabled devices to dynamically price premiums according to observed behavior
Using inputs from all kinds of devices, including geolocation tracking of cars to the activity trackers on our body, these companies are building more finely delineated groupings of risk, allowing products to be priced more competitively. Many insurtech startups are funded by established insurers, as well as venture capitalists.

Insurtech emerged around 2010 as an offshoot of the endeavor in banking, known as “fintech.” It is most consistently used to refer to the use of apps, wearables, big data, machine learning, and other transformative technologies to automate and improve processes across the insurance value chain – from marketing and policy origination through underwriting, services, and claims

## Company

Lemonade is one of the pioneers in the field of InsurTech.

* Lemonade offers homeowners insurance, renters insurance, car insurance, pet insurance and term life insurance in the United States as well as contents and liability policies in Germany and the Netherlands and renters insurance in France powered by artificial intelligence and behavioral economics. As a Certified B-Corp, where underwriting profits go to non-profits, the company is remaking insurance as a social good.

* Lemonade is an Insurtech company which is on a mission to disrupt the traditional insurance industry, that's worth a staggering $5 trillion globally. Lemonade aims to do this by offering its user-friendly app and customer-centric approach to selling insurance. Traditional insurance companies are known for having a poor user experience and can be expensive


* Lemonade was founded in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 2015 and is headquartered in New York, NY, United States

* Lemonade was founded by Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger (co-founder of Fiverr) in April 2015. Schreiber is a former SanDisk Executive who has a number of Patents under his name. But more importantly, he is a fantastic storyteller and great marketer. Part of Lemonade's high valuation during the IPO was driven by the storytelling ability of the brand and Schreiber himself. Co-Founder Shai Wininger is also a class act, as the former founder of Fiverr (FVRR) he is a veteran entrepreneur and a technology genius. 

* Idea of Lemonde CEO Schreiber, 48, was born in Britain, raised in Israel, earned a law degree in London and started working on tech mergers at a Tel Aviv firm. At 26, he quit law to cofound an internet security company. While that startup wasn’t a big success, Schreiber went on to hold senior marketing and management jobs in tech, most recently as president of Israeli wireless-charger maker Powermat. But he wanted another go at his own startup and kept looking for a big idea. By 2015, he had concluded that insurance was ripe for tech disruption because, he says, “every person in the nation, in the world, needs insurance,’’ and yet many distrust traditional insurers. A VC introduced Schrei­ber to Wininger, a self-taught Israeli coding and design whiz who had already cofounded four businesses, including Fiverr, an Israel-based marketplace for freelance work. Wininger, now 45, quickly signed on as cofounder, heading up tech and product design.

* Lemonade issued its first policies in September 2016 in New York. By January, marketing man Schrei­ber was boasting in a press release and blog post that Lemonade had set a world record by paying one New Yorker’s claim for his stolen Canada Goose parka in three seconds—the time it took Lemonade’s claims bot to run 18 antifraud algorithms and send bank instructions to deposit $729 in the man’s account.

* Funding -  In December 2015, raises $13m through investors Sequoia Capital and Israeli VC Aleph. In the same period, Series A and B funding rounds generate a further $48m in investments to expand the company. In 2017 Allianze and Sound Ventures join up, as well as SoftBank - raising the investment total to $180m. In 2019-2020 period Lemonade announced a further $300m investment from SoftBank taking its investment capital total to $480m. In July 2020 Lemonade became a public company.


## Business Activities

#### Problem Solved 
Lemonade powered by a unique combination of artificial intelligence and behavioral economics disrupted the centuries-old insurance industry. Insurance was not an obvious place to innovate, and the industry has gone largely untouched by technology for more than a century. Insurance industry that performs such an important societal role is often perceived negatively. Transparency and overcoming conflicts of interest a significant pillar of Lemonade

#### Customers
  
Insurtech companies such as Lemonade aim to solve this problem by introducing a self-service, low-friction experience for typicak customers who might be looking for a homeowners insurance, renters insurance, car insurance, pet insurance or term life insurance, optimized with Artificial Intelligence. Lemonade's technology reportedly enables customers to save up to 80% on their insurance cost in less than 90 seconds. No complex form filling or questions to try and catch you out, just a simple and easy user experience. Greatest thing with this company is that if there is unclaimed money at the end of the year, the company gives up to 42% to a charity of the customers choosing. This is called the "Give back" scheme and is a genius move to not only align the interests of the company and customers, but also to appeal to the socially conscious millennial.

#### Unique offering
Lemonade works on the principle that insurance companies can cut costs and automate more of their processes if they can somehow incentivize users to act less selfishly and commit less fraud. Traditionally insurance companies take the spread between premiums and claims as profit, but Lemonade aims to donate unclaimed premiums to charity once a year in a “Giveback” to discourage fraud.

Compared to other home insurance offerings, Lemonade is both inexpensive and simple to use

#### Unnfair advantage
* The charity angle from Lemonade is an attempt to prevent fraud from happening by linking the monetary loss due to fraud, not to the big-bad insurer, but to a softer, more sympathetic victim. Fundamentally, if you are a Lemonade policyholder and your claim is fraudulent is any way, you are depriving some charity of much needed funds

* When you buy a policy from Lemonade, the 20% fee goes immediately to the brokerage firm. The remaining 80% stays with the insurer. The paper on which the insurer is based is a B-corporation, which essentially makes it a non-profit. So it is the brokerage part of the business that is the money maker. That is the entity that secured all that seed-funding. Sequoia Capital knows a thing or two about making sound investments. They don’t do non-profits. And once the fee from the premiums that the policyholder pays gets swept into the Lemonade’s brokerage company, it will not be used to pay claims, at all…ever. It is income, free of insurance risk. If the insuring entity ever goes insolvent, all the fees will be protected


## Technology 

* AI and machine learning form the backbone of Lemonade’s products, which are designed to help customers purchase policies and file claims efficiently. The challenge the insurance industry has faced until the arrival of companies like Lemonade was not collecting or storing necessary data but analyzing and producing insight that will enable companies to give their customers a much more effective and overall better service. Lemonade, which has been “cloud-native” since its launch, relies on a number of programming types and languages to support its platform and services. 

* Initially, Lemonade launched its debut product on what is known as a Ruby monolith – a single-tiered software application where the user interface and data access code are combined a single program from a single platform. The emergence of car and pet insurance at Lemonade accelerated its transition to microservices written in Node and Typescript. The company also relies on Lokalise - a cloud-based localization and translation management system that can offer services in multiple languages.

* Interactions with customers generate a trove of data, which in turns is used to improve customer experience. Couple of bots named like AI Maya and AI Jim play and important role in the customer onboarding process and customer experience. AI Maya bot sells Lemonade policies and personalizes coverage, generates quotes and facilitates payment. AI Jim is a claims bot that handles first of notice loss” for most Lemonade claims and often manages an entire claim through resolution without any human involvement Combining automation and AI with fast and efficient analysis of large quantities of data has lead to a huge improvement in the tech process of the insurance industry.
* Technolgies/framewroks used by Lemonade includes Python, Swift, Ruby, Rails, Cloudflare, Docker etc. 

## Landscape

#### Domain
This company is focused on the insurance industry and trying to combine technology to solve long standing problems.

#### Major Trends
* Like the fintech Buy Now Pay Later revolution, insurtech is experiencing a seismic shift of its own. The embedded insurance space is a total game changer for both customers and the insurance industry across multiple sectors. 

* It's no longer acceptable for customers to have to fill out claims forms with pens and paper and post them or email them back to the insurer. But despite the swift wheels of technology being in overdrive, these processes are still being used in a vast number of traditional incumbent insurance companies. Customer are voting with their wallets and taking their businesses elsewhere, to insurtechs that can provide them with UBI coverage for their cars in three clicks, and send them a roadside recover vehicle and start the claims process through real time reporting and a super app that uses imaging to assess damage at the roadside

#### Competitors
* Hippo - The London-based insurtech uses IoT devices to identify small issues at homes and have them fixed before developing into bigger problems that cause homeowners to file claims. Hippo has raised capital worth $209m to help it implement new insurance approaches

* Bima - The Stockholm-based insurtech focuses on emerging markets and has offices in 13 countries across Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Bima has established an exclusive partnership with mobile operator giants to help it serve more than 26 million customers as well as develop a robust technology platform

* Shift Technology - Shift Technology was founded in 2014, using innovative technology to solve the challenges facing the global insurance industry. Their AI-native SaaS solutions help insurers defeat fraud and automate claims

* Steppie - Steppie, formerly known as WeSavvy, was designed to capture and agregate lifestyle data and provides insurance policy rewards for healthy behaviors such as walking, running, and bicycling. The company has transformed the traditional insurance model from one that compensates customers for harm or loss to one that is more focused on prevention

* Policygenius - The New York-based online insurance marketplace, Policygenius, was launched in 2014 by co-founders Jennifer Fitzgerald and Francois De Lame. It is now considered America's leading online digital insurance portal

* Wefox - Wefox provides household, car, and private liability insurance and more, has offices in eight countries and over 1000 employees. The company has now been labelled the number one digital insurance provider in Europe


## Results

#### Business impact
* Insurance is one of the largest industries in the world. Property, casualty, and life insurance premiums amount to approximately $5 trillion globally and account for 11% of the gross domestic product in the United States, Customers tend to associate insurance providers with adverse events such as illnesses or accidents that compel them to submit a claim. Customers don’t like that large corporations are making money out of their misery. The very nature makes the industry not very likable.  Lemonade is rebuilding insurance from the ground up on a digital substrate and an innovative business model. By leveraging technology, data, artificial intelligence, contemporary design, and behavioral economics, Lemonade is making insurance more delightful, affordable, precise, and socially impactful. Lemonade’s chatbot, AI Maya, just takes 2 minutes to get covered with renters’ or homeowners’ insurance. Lemonade hopes to offer a similar experience for other insurance products over time. 

* Lemonade was built differently. Instead of profiting from unclaimed premiums, Lemonade takes a flat fee (25%) out of premium as profit and donates whatever money may be left, after paying claims and expenses, to charities (this is called the Lemonade Giveback)

#### Core Metrics 
Core metrics for measuring the success of companies in this domain are Customers, Annual revenue, The average premium 
* Lemonade has 1,000,802 customers. The insurance company added 357 thousand new customers over the past year.
* The number of Lemonade customers has increased 3.24x since 2018.
* Renters insurance policies contribute the vast majority (91.36%) of the Lemonade customer base. 920,710 customers take out renters insurance through the platform.
* Lemonade acquired 357,684 new customers in 2020. That’s an increase of 7.11% over the previous year, when 333,923 new customers were added.
* Lemonade generated $94.4 million in revenue in 2020. That’s an increase of 40.27% over the previous year.
* Lemonade produced strong financials for the second quarter of 2022. Revenue was $50 million, which beat consensus estimates of $47.6 million. This was also up a blistering 77% year over year and 12% sequentially
* Inforce premium per customer (active policies) also increased by a substantial 54% year over year
* As of Q2 2022, Lemonade's total customers stand at 1.58 million, growing at 31% year over year


#### Performace advantages relative to competitors in the same domain
* Lemonade does have about a billion dollars in cash and no long-term debt
* Lemonade has been around for a bit longer than many of the competitors, and that's given it time to scale its business a little bit more
* Lemonade has a few different products already compared to competitors. They have renters, homeowners, pet insurance, and term life, and they are moving into auto insurance
*  Data advantage by being around longer and that data is the cornerstone of the AI
* It took just over four years for Lemonade reached 1 million customers. That's much faster than some of these legacy players. I think it took State Farm two decades to do the same things


## Recommendations


* If they could offer more products like the ones offered by Steepie that captures and aggregates lifestyle data and provides insurance policy, then it will reward healthy behaviors by customers such as walking, running, and bicycling. If they can offer products for a connected home and wearables, as well as the potential to change perceptions of insurance by moving away from an indemnity to protection focused model that will help. IoT-based InsurTechs have a promising future I think 

* IoT refers to a network or system of internet-connected devices transmitting, collecting, and sharing data. Offering IoT based products will tie into the lifestyle of the customers changing the perception about insurance companies more that Lemonade is trying to disrupt. 

* IoT and its various applications have significant insurance ramifications, as it allows the use of sensors to monitor an insured risk, transforming rough data into usable and easily processed information. Insurers can use this data to better assess risk and tailor their business approaches accordingly

* IoT applications can also give greater levels of granularity in risk modeling to improve underwriting and personalize insurance products and services. Insurers can use IoT to reduce costs and generate additional revenue by monetizing data insights from telematics of behaviors. In addition to providing greater customer interaction and cross-selling through telematics applications, the use of IoT to trigger maintenance will improve prevention mechanisms.

* Auto insurers have introduced usage-based or demand-adjusted pricing achieved by monitoring through IoT sensors. IoT will improve safety standards, as ambulatory services will be dispatched immediately after an accident occurs. The use of sensors in driving analytics will even enable the recognition of fraud.

* Another application of IoT is the wearable device, which has been called “the human body’s black box.” With the availability of wearable devices such as Fitbit® and Apple Watch®, health and life insurance companies can likewise track health data for insureds
